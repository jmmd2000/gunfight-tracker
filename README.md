Once you log in with your Google account, you can create a new team on the _Teams_ page.

Once the team is created, click through to the team page and add a new user via the team settings.<br/>

To add a team member, you'll need their friend-code, which can be found and copied on the _Stats_ page.

The user will then need to accept the team invite.

The team admin (or the other team member if allowed via the team settings) can then start to track the teams matches.

Adding new matches will automatically update the team and both users stats.
